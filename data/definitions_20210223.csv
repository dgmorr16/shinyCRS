1,Functional purposes,Cultural heritage & sense of place,"Cities should provide a sense of place which is defined as the degree of meaning people ascribe to a particular location. Sense of place echoes the intersections of culture, environment, history, politics and economics, and is impacted by global mobility, and blurred boundaries between natural and built environment. Sense of place is therefore closely connected to cultural heritage. Cultural heritage is a group of resources inherited from the past which people identify, independently of ownership, as a reflection and expression of their constantly evolving values, beliefs, knowledge, and traditions. Sense of place and cultural heritage is about the interaction between people and place through time, and a recognition of the intergenerational legacy of the built environment. Cities strive to have a strong identity which is deeply felt by its inhabitants and visitors.","Council of Europe, 2005; Russell et al., 2011.",This is about the specific cultural identity of a city.,
1,Functional purposes,Economic opportunity,"
Agglomeration in cities stimulates trade and allows for increased productivity. Citizens are more likely to find jobs suited to their skills in a city because of larger labour markets. Economic opportunity provides diversity of jobs and economic security, as well as investment in inclusive, sustainable economic growth.",World bank; Liberty Street Economics,"This is about the availability and diversity of work, and financial growth.",
1,Functional purposes,Globalised connectivity,"A city is a globalised and networked flow of materials, ideas and people that help build awareness to the relationship between the local and the global.  Cities contain economic, cultural, and institutional apparatus that channels national  resources into the global economy and that transmits the impulses of globalisation back to national centres. They have the potential to have an impact on wider global mechanisms through ‘local’ politics, not merely by defending and giving a voice to the local against the global, but seeking to alter the mechanisms of the global itself. Cities play an important role in shaping the global economy, culture and society, but they are also shaped by it.","Massey, 2004 Knox, 1996.",,
1,Functional purposes,Knowledge transfer & diffusion of innovation,"Cities are a hub for research centres and higher education institutions that set the cultural, social and intellectual tone of a city. Cities are not just mere containers for innovative ideas, but are actively involved in the generation of new ideas. A high level of provision of education, services, leisure activities combined with high population density and frequency of interaction found in cities favour social and technological innovation. Geographical proximity to knowledge has a strong effect on the number of educated people in a city, as ideas and technology flow out to surrounding businesses. This allows cities to empower and educate their citizens so they can become members in of society capable of engaging in a debate about their own environment.","European Commission, 2020; Smith, 2018.",,
1,Functional purposes,Physical settlement,"Cities provide adequate housing and accommodation which provides a home for people as well as driving tourism. A physical settlement within a city refers to the physical space and environment in which households are sheltered, and how one shelter related to another. The settlement is the physical platform that establishes the living space of which shelter is but one component. It is more than providing shelter, it is strategically integrated to the surrounding area, provides a family asset base, and facilitates social cohesion.","Smith, 2018; LeGrand and Malany, 2013.",,
1,Functional purposes,Pooling of resources,"Cities provide a collaborative process of bringing together a wide spectrum of actors that work together to co-design and co-produce shared, common goods and services at different scales. Pooling of resources is of vital importance to reduce the use of materials and energy in  cities. It helps to support emerging industry in a way that is financially efficient by pooling resources and tackling financial, regulatory, risk and market barriers together. Cities respond to cost pressures by seeking service arrangements that make possible to pool resources into shared services. Shared services represent a hybrid sourcing mechanism that combines the advantages of insourcing and outsourcing. Such services can produce economies of scope and scale, although they are predominately focused on serving internal citizens. Pooling of resources reduces resource constraints whilst providing more efficient services to a larger community. Examples include public services and utilities.","Scholl and AiAwadi, 2015",,
1,Functional purposes,Safety & security,"Urban safety refers to the extent to which a city’s inhabitants are able to live, work and participate in urban life without fear of bodily harm and intimidation. For a city to be safe, it requires security measurements such as law enforcement to respond to crime and reduce feelings of insecurity; emergency response; critical infrastructure that protects physical and mental health; community cohesion and peaceful coexistence by developing a sense of community and trust amongst city residents and working to reduce all forms of segregation within the city; cyber security and data protection. It includes both physical security and perception of safety.","Roberts, 2018",,
1,Functional purposes,Social opportunity and care,"Cities have higher population densities and draw people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Such diversity allows people to experience different religions and foods, whilst driving equal rights and participation for all. Moreover, a higher population density means that cities offer close proximity to healthcare that is better prepared for emergencies. Cities provide people with different social opportunities based on increased social networks and the overall environment in which they live.",World bank,,
