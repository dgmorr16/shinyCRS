## Acknowledgements
The "Urban system" tab is generated from an Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) analysis, a method developed at Heriot-Watt University. This method has been funded by UKRI EPSRC as part of Professor Lindsay Beever's *Water Resilient Cities project*, grant number EP/N030419/1, as well as an associated EPSRC Impact Acceleration Fund, *Urban system response and recovery: Development of an online tool to explore the impact of COVID-19*.
